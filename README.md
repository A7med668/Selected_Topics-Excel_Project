## 🧹 Data Preparation & Modeling

Before building the dashboard, extensive **data preprocessing** was performed to ensure data accuracy and consistency:

- **Removed duplicates** to eliminate redundant records.  
- **Dropped unnecessary columns** to simplify the dataset and improve performance.  
- **Created a Calendar Table** covering the entire sales period (1997–1998) for accurate time-based analysis.  
- **Established relationships** between fact and dimension tables such as `Sales`, `Customers`, `Products`, `Stores`, and `Region`.  
- Built **Pivot Tables** as the analytical foundation for the dashboard visualizations.

This process enabled efficient aggregation, dynamic filtering, and accurate time intelligence across the dataset.
