🛒 Food Mart Retail Analysis Project
The Food Mart Retail Analysis project is a comprehensive data cleaning, modeling, and visualization initiative built entirely in Microsoft Excel.
It aims to deliver actionable business insights into sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and regional trends for a retail business.
The dashboard consolidates key metrics and KPIs to support data-driven decision-making.

🧹 Data Preparation & Modeling
Before building the dashboard, extensive data preprocessing was performed to ensure data accuracy and consistency:

Removed duplicates to eliminate redundant records.
Dropped unnecessary columns to simplify the dataset and improve performance.
Created a Calendar Table covering the entire sales period (1997–1998) for accurate time-based analysis.
Established relationships between fact and dimension tables such as Sales, Customers, Products, Stores, and Region.
Built Pivot Tables as the analytical foundation for the dashboard visualizations.
This process enabled efficient aggregation, dynamic filtering, and accurate time intelligence across the dataset.
